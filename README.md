twity-boi
=========

A simple Twitter bot that reads the public stream of tweets and picks out tweets that fit the naming pattern of Mr. Tauheed Epps. Powered by [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython). Inspired by [@dariusk](https://github.com/dariusk).

This was almost an everyword-style bot.

Configured to run on Heroku. Gonna fill this part out later.
